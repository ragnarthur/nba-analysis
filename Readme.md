## 📘 Overview

This project aims to analyze the performance of NBA players during the regular season and playoffs using advanced metrics. The goal is to identify changes in player performance during critical moments and explore these variations by position.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various performance metrics such as:

- `raptor_box_offense`
- `raptor_box_defense`
- `raptor_offense`
- `raptor_defense`
- `war_reg_season`
- `war_playoffs`

Additionally, a fictitious position column categorizes players into positions: PG, SG, SF, PF, and C.

## 🔍 Key Analyses

1. **Playoffs vs. Regular Season Performance**:
   - Identified players who improved or declined in WAR (Wins Above Replacement) during the playoffs.

2. **Performance by Position**:
   - Analyzed average RAPTOR (Robust Algorithm using Player Tracking and On/Off Ratings) metrics by player position.

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

- **WAR Comparison**: Bar charts comparing WAR between the regular season and playoffs.
- **RAPTOR Box Metrics by Position**: Bar charts illustrating RAPTOR Box Offense and Defense by player position.
- **RAPTOR Metrics by Position**: Bar charts showing RAPTOR Offense and Defense by player position.
